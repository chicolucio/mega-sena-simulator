# Mega-Sena simulator

A Mega-Sena simulator. The [Mega-Sena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega-Sena) is the largest lottery in Brazil.
In the real life version of Mega-Sena, contestants may bet in the range of 6 to 15 numbers, out of 60, and scoring 4, 5
or 6 points will grant prizes. In this app version, only 6 numbers "bets" are allowed.

No real money bets are made. It is just a simple app for fun. There is no relation between this app and the real life
lottery and its organizers. I personally do not endorse or recommend gambling.

I made this project to practice fundamental skills on HTML, CSS and Javascript.
Tests on Javascript code were made with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

A live version of the app can be seen clicking on the button below:

The app was deployed on Netlify.

To run a local version:

```
git clone git@github.com:chicolucio/mega-sena-simulator.git
cd bmi
npm install
npm test
```

All tests must pass. Now, use any live server tool and open `index.html`.
For example, there
is [this live server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) for VSCode.
